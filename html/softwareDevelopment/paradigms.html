        <h1>Programming Paradigms</h1>
        <p class="expText">Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
            Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
        </p>
        <h2>declarative vs imperative paradigms</h2>
        <p class="expText">Most languages can be categorized in
            <b>declarative</b>- and <b>imperative</b>- paradigms.<br>The two are often used together (HTML and CSS
            together with JavaScript for websites).</p>
        <details>
            <summary>an analogy</summary>
            <p class="expText">In an analogy, the waiter in an restaurant would
                be the declarative paradigm, he is only concerned with taking and bringing the right order not how the
                meal is made. The chefs in the kitchen would be the imperative paradigm, because they are concerned how
                the meal is made.<br>
                The state of our sandwich changes over time as data (the ingredients) are added and mixed. The initial
                state might be an empty plate the final state is a prepared sandwich ready to be eaten. This is all
                done according to the sequenced instructions (the recipe) and the mutable data which is the composition
                of the sandwich.</p>
