        <h1>Programming Paradigms</h1>
        <p class="expText">Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
            Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
        </p>
        <h2>declarative & imperative paradigms</h2>
        <p class="expText">Most languages can be categorized in
            <b>declarative</b>- and <b>imperative</b>- paradigms.<br><br>In an analogy, the waiter in an restaurant
            would
            be the declarative paradigm, he is only concerned with taking and bringing the right order not how the meal
            was made. The chef in the kitchen would be the imperative paradigm, because they are concerned how the meal
            is made.</p>
